  <h1>Summary and additional work</h1>

           <p>
            This project aims to examine the everchanging landscape of modern day film and identify the potential influence of specific external factors, such as audience ratings and budget, on this landscape. Unfortunately, this data does not reflect how the industry has been affected by the uprising of private streaming companies. The normalization of household streaming services, such as Netflix or Peacock, has drastically affected the format, budget, and revenue sources of this industry. Furture directions for this project could be searching for additional data containing information about which streaming platforms movies are offered on, in order to properly examine how distrbitiom via streaming platforms affects movie popularity and revenue.
