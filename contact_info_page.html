        <h1>Summary & Future Directions</h1>

           <p>This project aims to examine the everchanging landscape of modern day film and identify the potential influence of specific external factors, 
            such as audience ratings and budget, on this landscape. From the interactive scatter plot, we can see that increases in budget have little to no net effect on revenue 
            but do have a positive correlation with popularity. This suggests that while higher budgets may not guarantee higher revenue, they do attract a larger audience. From the interactive scatterplot we can see
            that popularity does not necessarily result in high ratings and that genres play a crucial part in shaping audience satisfaction and appeal. From the dropdown chart we can see, ___________. From the histogram we can see, ___________.</p>
            
        
            
           <p> Unfortunately, this data does not reflect how the industry has been affected by the uprising of private streaming companies. 
            The normalization of household streaming services, such as Netflix or Peacock, has drastically affected the format, budget, and revenue sources of this industry. 
            We hypothesize that the rise of streaming services has led to a decrease in the number of people going to theaters,
            which in turn has led to a decrease in revenue for the movie industry. This is because streaming services have made it easier for people to watch movies from the comfort of their own homes,
            rather than going out to theaters. This has led to a shift in the way movies are marketed and distributed, with more emphasis being placed on streaming platforms rather than traditional theaters.
            This shift has also led to a change in the types of movies being produced, with more focus on blockbuster hits and less on smaller, independent films.
            Future directions for this project could be searching for additional data containing information about which streaming platforms movies are offered on, 
            in order to properly examine how distrbitiom via streaming platforms affects movie popularity and revenue.
