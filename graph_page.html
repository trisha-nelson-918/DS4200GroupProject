        <p>Given the changing economic climate of the past two decades, the budgets allotted to produce movies has substantially increased over the years. How does this increase in movie production budget impact the movie's overall popularity and revenue once it is released? Moreover, what movie genres typically have the biggest budgets and does that help them generate more revenue or popularity? </p>

         <p>The graphs above demonstrate the relationship between movie budget and multiple factors: revenue,popularity,and vote_average. As you can see from the slider bar, movie budgets drastically increase from the years 2000-2024. However, this increase has no overall impact of the amount of revenue produced. Except for a few special cases in which the revenue is very high, revenue stays within the same range even though the budget increases. On the other hand, as budget increases, movie popularity slightly increases. However, even though more people are going to see these movies with higher budgets, their reviews become more polarized. In other words, higher budget movies evoke a wider variety of feelings and opinions than movies with smaller budgets. Overall, these graphs function to demonstrate that higher budgets do not always correlate to 'better' movies. A bigger movie budget is not an indicator for better revenue or better audience reviews, but may attract a larger audience. </p>
