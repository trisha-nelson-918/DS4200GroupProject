            <h2>Symptoms of DMD</h2>
            <p>The most prominent symptom of DMD is muscle weakness. The weakness usually first starts in the muscles closest to the center of the body, which is called the proximal muscles. It then progresses to the distal limb muscles, which are the muscles of the lower arms and legs, and the feet and hands. The individual affected would have difficulty running, walking, and leaping. Other physical symptoms include swelling of the calves so that they enlarge to a great amount, an inward curve of the spine, and a waddle-like gait. As DMD progresses, it starts to affect the individualâ€™s respiratory and heart muscles, which can lead to failure of either muscle. Growth speed in children diagnosed with DMD tends to be much slower in the first few years of life due to degeneration. Genetically, variations in the LTBP4 and regulatory region of the SPP1 genes influence the degeneration of muscle strength in individuals with DMD.</p>
            <h3>Treatments of DMD</h3>
            <p>There is no cure for DMD, however, there is ongoing research and treatments that can alleviate symptoms of DMD. This includes the usage of corticosteroids, occupational and physical therapy, and other steroid medications. In June of 2023, the first gene therapy of DMD was introduced to the market called Elevidys. Elevidys was created to treat the causes of DMD by delivering a gene coding for a functioning shortened dystrophin into the tissue of the muscle affected. Other strategies being implemented for DMD include exon skipping, stop codon read-through, and gene repairing.</p>
