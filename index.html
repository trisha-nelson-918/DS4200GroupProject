            <h2>What is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?</h2>
            <p>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, is a rare neuromuscular genetic disorder that is characterized by progressive heart and skeletal muscle degeneration. DMD mainly affects boys, and symptoms show up at a very young age in their lives. This is due to alteration of the protein dystrophin that acts as a stabilizer for contractions of the muscle, preventing any damage due to contractions. Dystrophin also mediates cell signaling involving transduction and adhesion. Since DMD alters the dystrophin gene, a deletion, point, or duplication mutation occurs so that dystrophin is, as a result not produced and causes severe muscle damage. DMD is an X-linked recessive inheritance disorder, so it is passed onto children by their mother, also referred to as the carrier. DMD affects approximately 6 out of 100,000 individuals in North America and Europe, so it is officially classified as a rare genetic disorder.</p>
            <p>Research and therapies are ongoing for DMD, with awareness being spread across communities and those who suffer from DMD. You can access more information about the current research on DMD on the “About DMD” page on this website.</p>
            <p>I have decided to focus my website on DMD, as I am very interested in studying neurological and neuromuscular disorders. DMD is a disorder that interests me in the way it exhibits itself and the inner workings of the disorder.</p>
