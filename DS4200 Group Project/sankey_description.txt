From the three Sankey diagrams, it's clear that the drama genre has consistently held strong over the decades, from the 2000s to the 2020sâ€”frequently generating around $10 to $50 million in revenue, highlighting its enduring appeal across generations. Action, adventure, and animation consistently dominate the revenue charts, with action notably exhibiting a wide range of both budget and revenue, which aligns with its high-risk, high-reward nature. Adventure and action also stand out as some of the most expensive genres to produce, which makes sense given their reliance on stunts, special effects, and often large-scale productions. Interestingly, animation has seen significant growth since the 2000s, likely boosted by advances in technology that have made the genre more appealing and accessible to a global audience. The emergence of science fiction as a top 10 genre in the 2020s, matching its budget with equivalent revenue, signals a shift in viewer interest toward futuristic and tech-driven narratives, possibly taking the place of fantasy, which noticeably disappeared after the 2000s. This transition may reflect changing cultural fascinations, where sci-fi now serves as the modern vehicle for imaginative storytelling once held by fantasy. Documentaries made their way into the top 10 during the 2010s, perhaps driven by the streaming boom and rising interest in real-world stories. The noticeable absence of romance in the 2020s category may be because it has been absorbed into hybrid genres or has lost some mainstream appeal. Meanwhile, horror has grown increasingly well-funded and popular, likely due to advancements in editing and production technology that make it far more immersive and engaging than in the past. Collectively, these shifts reveal how technological evolution and changing audience preferences continue to reshape the cinematic landscape.
