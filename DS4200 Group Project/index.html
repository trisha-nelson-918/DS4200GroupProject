    <h3> General Introduction  </h3>

    <p> Have you ever noticed how different movies are nowadays? With the evolution of new technologies, such as advanced CGI and deep fakes, modern-day movies are drastically different from those made in the previous generations. In addition, the sheer number of movies being created and production budgets have skyrocketed within the past few years.  </p>

    <p>Examination of modern-day movie preferences can reflect numerous things about how society as a whole has shifted its perception of the world and what is deemed socially acceptable at the given time. A movie’s success can only be determined by its audience, which makes it important for major film production companies to extrapolate what aspects of film their audiences enjoy and how those aspects change over time. </p>

    <p> Studies by large organizations, such as <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/02/11/how-has-movie-marketing-and-distribution-evolved-over-time/">Forbes</a> </strong>, and, <strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@TheRewindZone/the-evolution-of-movie-genres-examining-shifts-in-popularity-and-diversity-from-the-90s-to-today-ca1ffd1ca445/" >Medium</a> </strong>, have demonstrated that producers are perceptive to the opinions of their audiences, and consequently produce movies to accommodate those opinions. In other words, public perception is responsible for changing the direction of the movie industry and how we consume media as a whole. Understanding how the public interacts with modern day film can be the key to keeping the era of modern day film alive.</p>


    <h3>Introduction to the Datsaset</h3>

    <p> We chose to source our dataset from Kaggle, an online platform dedicated to providing a variety of datasets, tools, and resources related to data science. We specifically decided to use the <strong> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/imdb-data">IMDb Movie Data</a> </strong>, published by Anand Shaw. IMDb is an online website and community that is deemed to be one of the most popular and wide-spanning sources for movie and television content. This dataset specifically contains detailed information on movies listed on IMDb, including attributes and columns such as the title, genre, rating, release year, and important keyword categories. The detailed information about all this dataset's features are listed
        in the following table:</p>  
        <p> The columns that are the most important to our project would be the ‘title’, ‘genres’, ‘vote_count’, ‘vote_average’ to help with determining what movies in what genres score higher, as well as ‘revenue’ and 'budget' to determine what movies performed well, and ‘release_date’, and ‘keywords’. However, this dataset is expansive in size; it contains twenty-one columns and 903263 rows which gives us a great deal of data to sort through and also utilize. Additionally, with this dataset containing hundreds of thousands of observations, it sets up an ideal overview for us to pick what to analyze, in our case being movie genre preference over time. </p>

        <p> Since we are investigating trends in genre popularity and how they could be influenced by cultural trends, introductions to new kinds of technology, and our consistently evolving surroundings, we want to focus on data ranging from the 2000s to current day. By filtering out films released far before the 1950s and in plans for production and release in the future, we hope to find trends in genre preferences over time. Therefore, in addition to filtering the data to this specific timeframe, we will also be voiding any rows of information consisting of movies that are in the works of being released. Additionally, any rows with missing or incomplete data will be cleaned as a part of pre-processing to ensure that our data visualizations consist of up-to-date and accurate information. Considering that our research question revolved around genres, we will begin our data analysis by grouping movies into their respective categories. Given this plan for our data analysis, we want our visualizations to reflect both timeline based trends and categorial trends </p>
